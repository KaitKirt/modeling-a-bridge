# 🌉 Bridge Deformation Simulation (MATLAB)

This MATLAB project models and analyzes the structural behavior of bridges under varying load conditions. It simulates bridge deformation using a linear system approach and visualizes both basic and force-deformed bridge structures for 1, 2, and 3-section designs.

## 📐 Key Features

- Models bridge structures using adjacency matrices and coordinate geometry
- Applies different weights (e.g., car vs truck) to simulate real-world force impact
- Calculates deformation using a system of linear equations
- Visualizes:
  - Basic bridge structures
  - Deformed bridges under light and heavy loads
  - Adjacency matrix via spy plot to reveal structural layout

## ⚙️ Methods & Concepts

- Beam length and force vectors
- Matrix algebra for solving deformation
- Adjacency matrix formulation
- Finite element-inspired deformation calculations
